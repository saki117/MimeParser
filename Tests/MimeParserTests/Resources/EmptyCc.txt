    Description

        This document provides a partial -- and not comprehensive -- list
        of implementations of Emacs-type editors and literature about such
        editors. You can help make it more comprehensive by sending me
        additional information and/or updates.

        This document is also gradually acquiring the role of a repository
        of (at least) Emacs-related history. While that subject requires a
        book to itself, this document will probably serve until someone
        (_not_ me!) writes one.

        This document is available via anonymous FTP and WWW. See above
        URLs.

        To be included in this list:

        o   A piece of literature should be a book, manual, article, paper,
            or something that covers (or mentions) Emacs in particular or
            text editing techniques in general. Specifically excluded are
            items that are only of interest to non-Emacs users (a book on
            "how to use vi") or vendor manuals for Emacs implementations
            (as those are implicitly included in the implementations).
            Non-vendor (i.e., third party) manuals are included.

        o   An implementation must either (1) be "advertised" as being an
            Emacs-type editor or (2) be extensible and come with an Emacs
            command set "mode" already written. Editors that are extensible
            but do not come with such a mode (i.e., you have to write it
            yourself) are not listed.

       The following information is included for each implementation:

        The *NAME* line contains the name of the implementation.
        Implementations are listed alphabetically by name. Acronym
        expansions are listed in ()s. Other acronyms:

            TECO    TAPE Editor and COrrector
                    (later: Text Editor and COrrector)
            EMACS   Editor MACroS

        The *LAST* *CHANGED/VERIFIED* line contains the date that the entry was
        last changed or an explict "looks ok to me" was received. This
        field was added 1994-12-20, so all entries were initialized to that
        value.

        The *ORIGINAL* *DISTRIBUTION* is the date (or partial date) of the
        first release. It is in YYYY-MM-DD format.

        The *VERSION* is the latest known version. It is probably out of
        date.

        The *BASE* *LANGUAGE* is the language that you need a compiler or
        interpreter for in order to use the editor. If the software is
        distributed as a pre-compiled binary, this should be the language
        that the program was written in.

        The *IMPLEMENTATION* *LANGUAGE* is the language that the bulk of the
        implementation is written in.

        The *EXTENSION* *LANGUAGE* is the (often custom or modified) language
        that the is used when altering or writing extensions to the
        implementation. It is "none" if there is no extension language.

        The *SCOPE* is either "command set" or "extensible." In the first
        case, the implementation offers a basic Emacs command set; however
        the user cannot readily change what the commands do. In the second
        case, the user can fully control what all of the commands do.

        The *REQUIREMENTS* is a brief characterization of what hardware or
        software is required. The purpose of this item is to offer a broad
        selection key; not be a comprehensive list. You should consult the
        implementation (for free software) or the vendor to find out
        whether a specific implementation works in your environment. For
        example:

        o   "UNIX" refers to any version of UNIX(tm) from any vendor.
        o   "IBM PC" is used to cover MS/DOS, OS/2, and Windows
            implementations.

        (Starting Dec 1994 the list will support an additional level of
        detail for IBM PCs.)

        o   "DOS" refers to MS/DOS support. May also run under Windows or
            OS/2 in some mode. - "Windows" refers to Microsoft Windows support.
        o   "OS/2" refers to to OS/2 support. - "Windows NT" refers to
            Microsoft Windows NT support.

        The *ORGANIZATION* is the name of and contact information for the
        implementor OR >CURRENT MAINTAINER<.

        The *STATUS* is one of

        o   no longer available: Self-explanatory.
        o   free: The implementation is available to most people at no
            charge. Even such "free" implementations may have restrictions:
            consult information about the particular implementation. Where
            available, information on how to obtain a copy is also listed.
        o   not free: The implementation is for sale. Contact the vendor
            for specifics.

        Many of the names of the implementations in this list are
        trademarked. Specific trademarks are not called out.

        Full source code is available for all of the free implementations.
        Source availability varies among the not free implementations:
        check with the vendor before you buy.

            This is a bare-bones Japanese version of EMACS.  It's missing all
            the cool GNU-stuff (including help),  but it does do split-
            screening and all of the cursor/text editing commands that I
            tried.  It's a 86.7K (yes, that's kilobytes!) download.  A very
            sweet blend of EMACS and Macintosh technology.

            Version 20.6.  This is by far the most comprehensive and
            fastest version of EMACS for the Mac.  It is also the most
            actively developed version I know of.  Even mail can be
            implemented by remapping mail calls to Eudora-Lite Applescripts.
            The only bummer is that there is no GNUS and no printing!

        _Note:_ the name is an abbreviation of "Anti-MISAER" (where "AE" is
        the "ae" glyph). "Misaer" is Swedish (svenska) for "piece of junk,
        or deep shit functionality" (translation provided by the person who
        told me about this) The name thus means "not a piece of junk."
        Tops10, RSTS, Norsk Data versions are free, send them a 1/2 inch,
        2400-foot magnetic tape and return postage VMS version is $1000 US
        (the money supports their DEC10 museum)

        Addendum from Jesper Larsson <Jesper.Larsson@dna.lth.se>: This is
        not quite correct. First, if "misAEr" is the Swedish word, "AE"
        should not be the "ae" glyph (not used in Swedish -- maybe it's
        spelled that way in Norwegian), but an "a" with two dots above
        it. Secondly, this word actually means "destitution" or "penury".
        It is closely related to the English word "misery". [ I am _not_
        going to get in the middle of a how to translate Swedish to
        English issue here -- Craig ]

            a bit of history...the source was posted to the net by James
            Gosling (in about 1980-ish, I think). It was modifed by Barry,
            within Digital Equipment Corporation. It ran on VMS and was
            available only internally to Digital. The language changed to
            Bliss-32 (better performance on VMS) and then to C (for
            portability) and now C++. Barry left Digital in 1994 and about
            then (or perhaps a little sooner?) released to the public.

        Emacs supports the X window system. It continues to fully support
        the X window system as well.

        Also, this may be new information on the same release: Emacs.app, a
        full port of GNU Emacs to NeXTstep also supporting NS features,
        runs on Intel, NeXT, and HP hardware.

        <emacs-for-ns-users@lists.princeton.edu> and
        <emacs-for-ns-announce@lists.princeton.edu>. The former is intended
        for general discussion and allows anybody to post. The latter
        restricts posting and should contain only a handful of
        announcements of new releases every year. Both of these lists are
        handled by the CREN Listproc which means that you can subscribe and
        unsubscribe automatically. For example, to subscribe to
        emacs-for-ns-users I'd send a message with the content `SUBSCRIBE
        emacs-for-ns-users Carl Edman' to <listproc@lists.princeton.edu>.
        For more details write to the same address with the content `HELP'.

        This is the second public release of Emacs for NeXTstep (**).

        ** So why in the world is it called version 4.1 ? To avoid
        confusion with the older Emacs.app interface (lately up to
        version 3.1) which is completely unrelated except for the fact
        that its author, Michael Brouwer, has been a major contributor to
        this project as well. And even he has replaced the old Emacs.app
        with Emacs for NeXTstep.

        personal computer) version was released as a non-profit distribution
        to the public in 1987. It is now kept in all the anonymous FTP
        archives for that machine. It was in daily use by thousands. It
        integrated an Emacs-like editor, command line history, etc. into a
        very compact program. These features are now common-place in modern
        shells.

                    http://space.mit.edu/%7Edavis/jed.html
            From a user:

        ...and I think it is worth to mention that JED (which is the
        "GNUishest" of all the non-GNU implementations -- almost *every*
        keystroke is like within GNU/XEmacs) has the complete editing
        part of the AUCTEX-package built in, with BibTeX-mode, so if you
        have to edit La/BibTeX-source outside your home/business, JED
        might be your first choice.

        And, what's more than that: JED runs on the smallest PC systems
        used these days: in the library etc. I take my Toshiba T1000
        (which was the first laptop and has a 4.77 MHz CPU in it: 512 KB
        RAM, *no* HD and a single FD) -- and works like a charm since it
        loads the necessary modules into memory only when needed (dired
        etc.).

        Unlike "freemacs" (which was my favourite editor before JED) it
        can manage files over 64 KBytes in size and it is further under
        development.

        Since it runs on Linux to (with a special XJed binary) I use it
        for quick tasks on my desktop, too.

        _Note:_ With the multilingual support now merged into NTEmacs in
        20.4, it is no longer necessary to use a special version of Emacs
        for other languages, but MULE users may find upgrading to Meadow
        easier than to NTEmacs because of slight differences in the way
        they handle fonts. Meadow also has a couple of features that are
        still missing from NTEmacs, such as support for native IMEs and
        the special keys on Japanese keyboards.

            later maintained and supported by beopen.com (now defunct)

        _Notes:_ InfoDock is an integrated productivity toolset, mainly
        aimed at technical people. It is built atop the XEmacs variant of
        GNU Emacs and so has all of the power of Emacs, but with a much
        easier to use and more comprehensive menu and toolbar-based user
        interface. We find that most objections people raise to using Emacs
        have already been addressed in InfoDock. See
        http://infodock.sourceforge.net for more information.

    Multics Emacs

            last changed/verified: 2015-03-29
            original distribution: 1978
            version:
            base language: Lisp
            implementation language: Lisp

        _Note_ from Carl Hoffman: Probably Multics Emacs' greatest claims
        to fame are (1) having been the first to popularize the notion of
        using a Lisp-like extension language which non-expert programmers
        could use and understand, and (2) originating certain constructs
        (e.g. "save-excursion", etc.) which today survive in GNU Emacs.

        _Note_ from Bernard Greenberg: Multics Emacs was implemented in
        Multics MacLisp, also known as Version 2 Lisp. Multics Emacs was
        the first and only Multics Software Product in Lisp -- PL/I was the
        official system language.

        The notion of using Lisp for a mainframe product whose native
        language was not Lisp was radical at the time. I chose Lisp because
        of the possibility of implementing many small, cheap, modular,
        easily-replaceable functions (not a possibility in PL/I), having
        found this to be a major feature of an earlier private tool I
        implemented in Multics MacLisp.

        The notion of using Lisp on the Lisp machine (for Eine, and later
        Zwei) was a requirement, not an innovation. It did not speak to the
        issues of the suitability of Lisp for such a task, nor to that of
        what would be the best language for such a task. The idea of
        -choosing- Lisp for a mainframe editor implementation was innovated
        here. The idea of augmenting Multics TECO, and that of writing a
        TECO-like editor gut in flat-out PL/I were rejected by me in favor
        of a Lisp program that implemented editor functionality.

        Inspired by the TECO in which EMACS (on ITS, then the only program
        using that name) was implemented, I designed a TECO-like control
        and "point" manipulation model in a Lisp framework, which I thought
        was natural and obvious, not at all similar to the buffer-pointer
        passing model of the Lisp Machine editors. The natural combination
        of Lisp macrology and scoping with this type of model proved to be
        flexible, powerful, and appealing: this model caught on, and is now
        the basis of everything in the world; the Lisp machine's did not.
        The intellectual lineage of GNU Emacs, in these regards, comes
        directly from James Gosling's Emacs, which came directly from (and
        was credited to) Multics Emacs.

        I rank the significant innovations of Multics Emacs as: (1)
        Explicitly-designed extension languages, which could be understood
        and used by non-experts. (2) Lisp as an editor implementation
        language. (3) Lisp and Lisp-macros as an extension language. (4) A
        control regime and macrology, including many names (e.g.,
        "save-excursion"), that have become today become semi-standard
        through GNU Emacs and other systems.

        Major extensions that became part of the product should also be
        credited to Richard Lamson, Gary Palter, and William York, who
        became my guerilla band, back then.

        _Note:_ Win-Emacs is derived from XEmacs 19.6 (nee Lucid Emacs).
        Win-Emacs is a native MS-Window app which supports multiple
        windows, fonts, code highlighting, arbitrary keymapping, DDE,
        winsock, long filenames, drag-and-drop, etc. Version. 1.5 is a
        Win32s app with most Unix features (e.g. asynch. subprocesses). The
        free version of Win-Emacs is based on a nagware X emulator: a nag
        screen pops up every half-hour; otherwise it is precisely identical
        to the supported commercial version of Win-Emacs. Debatable whether
        this should be moved into the "versions that cost" category.

        Ben Wing, the main author of Win-Emacs, is now the most productive
        active developer of XEmacs.  Most features of Win-Emacs have been
        added to XEmacs.

        Z80EMACS is a port of microemacs 3.6 to the CP/M operating system.
        Microemacs keeps all data in memory, and CP/M must live in a 64KB
        address space. By clever use of overlays and byte-squeezing and
        tuning, Z80EMACS is able to edit files of size 30KB! microemacs 3.6
        had no facility for remapping the keyboard bindings. Z80EMACS does
        it with an offline utility. Z80EMACS uses overlays extensively, but
        the most frequently used commands are all either in the root
        segment or in one particular overlay. Since this overlay is usually
        already in memory, performance is quite good, even when running
        from floppies. Z80EMACS has the ability to edit multiple files,
        display multiple windows, and do keyboard macros, among other
        things. This makes it the spiffiest CP/M editor you could ever hope
        to see. Z80EMACS comes with source and binaries; it was compiled
        with AZTEC C, which few CP/Mmers have, so the binaries are more
        likely to be useful than the source.

        This editor identifies itself as "Emacs", and has HP-style soft
        labels for the first eight function keys hard-bound to "file
        commands," "window commands," "buffer commands," etc. Versions 1.1
        and 2.1 are known to exist. Other versions may also have escaped.
        1.1 was written in Microsoft C and 8088 assembler 1.0 (or was that
        2.0?) in about 1985. 2.1 was written using Microsoft C 3.0 in about
        1986. All versions work quite usably, despite fatal bugs in some
        commands. (Memory limits and large files can cause death,
        "ESC-digit" causes immediate death.) ("If it dies when you do that,
        stop doing it!")
